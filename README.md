# Advanced Data Analytics for Business (Uni Project)
## Text Classification Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for an advanced text classification project aimed at categorizing text data, presumably essays or similar content. The project uses deep learning techniques with the Hugging Face Transformers library and includes a dataset for analysis and model training.

...

## Loading the Data

### Dataset: `wiki_data.csv`

This repository includes a dataset named `wiki_data.csv` containing various columns of information critical for the text classification task.

### Data Preparation

1. **Navigate to the Data Folder:**
   - After cloning the repository, navigate to the `Data` folder within the repository. This folder contains all the necessary data files and scripts to get started.

2. **Running the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Inside the `Data` folder, you'll find a Jupyter Notebook file, named `Load_Data.ipynb`.
   - Open this notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. You can do this by running `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` in your terminal or command prompt, navigating to the notebook, and opening it.

3. **Load and Preprocess the Data:**
   - Run the code provided in `Load_Data.ipynb` to load and preprocess the data. The notebook contains detailed steps and explanations for each part of the process.
   - If required, uncomment and execute the `!pip` commands at the beginning of the notebook to install or upgrade the `datasets` package.

4. **Generate the `wiki_data.csv`:**
   - The notebook will process the necessary data and create the `wiki_data.csv` file in the same folder. This file will be used for subsequent data analysis and machine learning tasks.

### Using the Data

- Once the `wiki_data.csv` file is generated, it's ready for use in your data analysis, machine learning modeling, or any other tasks as required by the project.
- Refer to the specific notebooks mentioned in the [Usage](#usage) section for detailed instructions on how to use this data for text classification tasks.
